### Project4: [How Much Did Covid-19 Affect the Airbnb on Booking Houses (Based on New York)](https://github.com/weicheng-su/Airbnb_Project/blob/master/airbnb_New_York_2019_Dec_to_2020_May.ipynb)
- Analyzed the data from [inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) during December 2019 to May 2020.
- Created plots to show how much did the booking decrease due to the covid-19 pandemic.

- March to April has the highest **cancel rate**, which matches the time of the covid-19 pandemic outbreak in New York.
- The cancel rate during March to April is about **0.13**, which is really high. Compare to the Dec-Jan and Jan-Feb, they only have around **0.04** cancel rate.

<br>

- The total numbers of how many houses people booked had decreased sharply, from 1.1 million houses to 600 thousand house.

<br>
<img src="images/number_of_canceled_houses.png" width="450"/>

- The total number of people who canceled their bookings during March-April is 110000, which is the highest among all, and it's about three times of the number of canceled houses on Dec-Jan and Jan-Feb.
- We can observe that the covid-19 did cause the Airbnb to lose a lot of bookings.
